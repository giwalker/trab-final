This repository has 2 folders. 

They are "Entrega_1", and "Entrega_2". The first one are the files from the first part of the assignment, with the codes from the Embedded System and the windows system.
The "Entrega_2" have the files from the "Hello World" app, and the embedded System and windows system with a few modifications to correct some bugs found in the "test plan".

Disclaimer:
Because I'm having trouble spliting the Embbedded code in multiple files in Keil IDE, I developed and test the code in just one main.cpp file.
After the code has been tested, I manually splitted the code in multiple files. And, because of that, I share both versions. The single one, that I'm sure works, 
and the multiple-files version, that It's the same code, just splitted to be better understood.
I didnt do this in the second "delivery" because i did just minnors modifications, and conclude that are no need to spend time on that.

So, the directories are, for the first "delivery":
keil-single -> This is the single code from the Embbedded application
keil-multiple-files -> These are the files from the Embbedded application code
visual-studio-windows -> These are the files from the host application code
