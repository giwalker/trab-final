This repository has 3 folders. 

Because I'm having trouble spliting the Embbedded code in multiple files in Keil IDE, I developed and testes  the code in just one main.cpp file.
After the code has been tested, I manually splitted the code in multiple files. And, because of that, I share both versions. The single one, that I'm sure works, 
and the multiple-files version, that It's the same code, just splitted to be better understood.

So, the directories are:
keil-single -> This is the single code from the Embbedded application
keil-multiple-files -> These are the files from the Embbedded application code
visual-studio-windows -> These are the files from the host application code
